-- | A small compatibility shim exposing the new types from transformers 0.3 and 0.4 to older Haskell platforms.
--   
--   This package includes backported versions of types that were added to
--   transformers in transformers 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 for users who need
--   strict transformers 0.2 or 0.3 compatibility to run on old versions of
--   the platform, but also need those types.
--   
--   Those users should be able to just depend on <tt>transformers &gt;=
--   0.2</tt> and <tt>transformers-compat &gt;= 0.3</tt>.
--   
--   Note: missing methods are not supplied, but this at least permits the
--   types to be used.
@package transformers-compat
@version 0.5.1.4


-- | Backports orphan instances which are not provided by other modules in
--   <tt>transformers-compat</tt>.
module Control.Monad.Trans.Instances
